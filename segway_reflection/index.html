  <h1>Segway and Course Reflection</h1>
  
  <p>As far as this assignment goes, I think I did pretty well on it.  I enjoyed making the Segway website as well.  As far as things I did well,  I really like how my FAQ page turned out with the JavaScript in it.  I was also a fan of just the overall style of the website.  I like the font choices, the new colors, and the border around the text.  Especially in the revised version, I am a fan of the new vertical spacing, I think I did a good job making everything breathe a little better.  I think my favorite little added touch that I couldn't live without is the in-depth nav element complete with the transitions (I really like the use of the transitions).  If I had to go back and redo this project there is only one big difference I would make.  Instead of using sections, I would definitely go back and use divs instead of just using a bunch of sections.  Or instead use others like articles and such.  I think using divs and more diverse layouts would make my website a little easier to manage.  Other than that, the things I disliked about the first version I fixed in the second one so that was good.  </p>
 
  <p> I asked my roommate what he thought about my first project and he gave me some good advice.  He said, similarly to what you suggested, to look into the vertical spacing/ height because that seems to be the biggest visible problem.  He said the heading could use more visual hierarchy as well.  As far as the FAQ, About, and Contact page, he didn't have much to say about those.  So I took his and your advice to go through and rework my padding and margins and height.  I used the Inspect Element tool to go through and make this easier as well.  I also improved the tagline and made it pop more with italics.  After listening to your suggestion about the typography, I changed the paragraphs to use a different font that I liked so that we could have some variance on the Homepage.  I also changed the background color to something that matched the palette a little bit better.  I pretty much changed all the things he suggested and I think it turned out for the better honestly.</p>
  <p>This semester has not been without its unique hardships, but I think this class really gave me a much needed change of pace from the usual engineering work i do.  It was nice to be able to learn a language for something as practical as HTML and website design.  I'm actually not that good at programming to be honest, so at first this class was pretty overwhelming.  But I think especially with this last project, I was really able to pull it all together and have your teachings come together and make sense.  CSS troubleshooting made me really understand what the code was saying.  Overall this semester, I did the Gravit portion really well because I have experience with Photoshop and Illustrator.  I think I also did well on this last project to an extent because It just finally came together for me.  I think the hardest stuff for me was the Positioning lab just because it was so in depth and it was a little difficult to wrap my head around.  Overall, I really didn't do as awful in this class as I originally thought, because I was able to learn a lot this semester with your teachings.</p>
