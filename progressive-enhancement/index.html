  <h1>My Thoughts on Progressive Enhancement</h1>
  
 <p>"Progressive enhancement" is a web development method or technique that provides a much more effective and ubiquitous product than "graceful degradation" provides.  This method was first introduced to the world at SXSW in 2003 by Steve Champeon and Nick Finck.  There they gave a presentation unveiling a new approch to web development coined progressive enhancement. Where graceful degradation focuses on building websites for the best and most modern web browsers, progressive enhancement simply focuses on the <em>content</em>. Graceful degradation was less than perfect, because it often left older web broswers in the dust.  With progressive enhancement, website are developed in layers starting with the content first.  Nothing really changes other than the frame of mind going into development, but instead of worrying about web browser capabilities, developers can focus on the content, and web browsers can just display the important parts regardless of CSS or JavaScript shortcomings.  Having a layered system that starts with content, then the CSS, and then topped with JavaScript makes sure that all web browsers can be used in conjuction with every website.    </p>
